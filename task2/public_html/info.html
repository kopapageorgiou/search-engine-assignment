                Makis Tsetsenoglou, a recently divorced middle-aged luxury furniture merchant
                in Kilkis cannot get over the fact that Tasoula, his wife, took the child with
                her. To drown his wounded ego, he goes to the provincial dog store called Vietnam
                where he is a regular patron, and after smashing all the dishes, sprinkling the
                singer with baskets of rose petals, even tearing the porcelain from the toilets,
                he decides to smash the store as well. He negotiates on the spot with the shopkeeper,
                gives all his millions in a check and calls Elias with his bulldozer. The party is
                moved to the front of the shop, the instruments continue the program, Elias arrives
                with his bulldozer, and to the accompaniment of the music the building is leveled.
                The chubby redeemed man douses his clothes with the last bottle of whiskey, lights
                a fire in his trench coat, which he always wears and never takes off, and with the
                instruments blaring, while the sun rises in the distance, he dances his last zebedeck
                dance away into the fields.</p>
